      <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        The MEAN Stack is a full-stack JavaScript framework that includes
        MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (a backend web application
        framework), Angular (a front-end framework), and Node.js (a runtime
        environment for running JavaScript on the server).

      <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        The MERN Stack is another full-stack JavaScript framework consisting of
        MongoDB, Express.js, React (a front-end library), and Node.js. It's
        popular for building modern web applications with a single programming
        language, JavaScript, across the entire stack.

      <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        The LAMP Stack is a traditional full-stack web development stack. It
        includes Linux (the operating system), Apache (the web server), MySQL
        (the database management system), and PHP (the server-side scripting
        language). It's been widely used for building dynamic web applications.

      <dt>JAMstack</dt>
      <dd>
        JAMstack is a modern architecture for web development. It stands for
        JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. In a JAMstack application, the frontend is
        built using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js, and the backend
        relies on APIs to deliver data and functionality. Static site generators
        are often used to create pre-built HTML pages.
